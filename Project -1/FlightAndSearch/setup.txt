--> npx sequelize model:generate --name City --attributes name:String  
--> npx sequelize db:migrate

To interact with the database(model)
--> create new file inside repository folder.

If we want to change any attributes properties then we have to change it inside both models folder and migrations folder and then delete previous migrations and make new one.

Create functions for insertion ,deletion ,etc in repository folder usign sequelize queries.

Create services from repository  .

create controllers from repository
