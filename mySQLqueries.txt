show databases;
-> show all the available databases in the system

create databases <file_name>;
-> creates a new database

use <file_name>;
-> start working on the database

drop database <file_name>;
-> delete the database

show tables;
-> to show all tables in a particular database 

--> to create a tables
create table <file_name>(
    title VARCHAR(30)   
      |      |     |
 attribute  type  maxLength
    VARCHAR == string

    id Int
    content VARCHAR(300)
)

desc <file_name>;
-> list of attributes of table

not null
-> used in creating table attributes whose values can never be null

auto_increment
-> automatically increments the value by 1 
also we have to give a primary key so that it could recognize it
ex - Id Int auto_increment
    primary key(Id);

--> Insert in table
insert into <file_name> (title,id, content) values (val1,val2,val3);
// if we want to put multiple inputs at same time -> 
insert into <file_name> (title,id, content) values (val1,val2,val3),(val1,val2,val3);

--> Retreive data from tables
select <attr1>,<attr2>... from <file_name>;
// for getting all attributes
select * from <file_name>;
// for getting chosen data      --> where clause
select * from <file_name> WHERE id > 2;  -> it will give me only that rows whose data had id attribute greater than 2.
// for getting data with operating with strings   --> like clause
select * from <file_name> where <attr> LIKE "%string%";
ex - select * from <file_name> where title LIKE "abc%";  // it gives all the rows with data having title whose prefix matches with abc and after that it can have anything

// we can also use AND ,OR operator with where clause


--> sorting of data
select * from <file_name> order by <attr> (DESC or ASC);
// we can also put another condition in case of conflict in first condition
select * from <file_name> order by <attr1> (DESC or ASC), <attr2> (DESC or ASC);
// we can also put limit on data to be shown 
select * from <file_name> order by <attr> desc LIMIT 2;
// we can also choose how many previous data we have to leave
select * from <file_name> order by <attr> desc limit 2 OFFSET 2;

--> update data
UPADTE <file_name> set <attr> = " ... " where <attr> = " ... ";
